Face recognition system on Raspberry pi (IoT)
(Based on Open CV) <br>

STEPS:
1. Run dataset.py to collect face data. <br>
2. Run trainer.py to train your data. <br>
3. Run rec.py to test your system. <br>

With proper training data and lightening conditions, prediction accuracy of more than 85% has been achieved. <br>
